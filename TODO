Notes on libsysdev...

The general purpose is to provide a sysfs-based library that can replace
libudev. This does not mean API/ABI-compatible; rather, it should provide
similar functionality without a daemon, and a program should be able to
link with both libsysdev and libudev at the same time (so libsysdev can
be used as a fallback when udevd is not running).
The --enable-sysfs code in mesa provided inspiration.
If someone wants to write a partial udev-compat shim, I'm open to including it.

The proposed API is based on a quick glance through xf86-input-evdev
and mesa to see where they need udev/what they do instead, plus a comment
on the devuan mailing list from Karl Hammar.
It relies on the user using open()/stat()/major()/minor() directly and
providing a little connecting logic.
By my reading, sysdev_getsyspath() should be enough for evdev,
while mesa would need sysdev_getproductids() as well.


things we need to find:
-/dev/name given major minor ischar
 (ischar = ('b'|'c') - 'b' or ISCHR(st.st_mode))
-/sys/devices/.../ given /dev/name (or major minor devtype)
 Look at /sys/dev/(block|char)/<major>:<minor>,
 then use readlink to get the canonical name.
 
 
/* given major/minor/type, return the device (in /dev) */
char * sysdev_getdevname(unsigned int major, unsigned int minor, int ischar);

DONE:
/* given major/minor/type, return the directory in /sys */
char * sysdev_getsyspath(unsigned int major, unsigned int minor, int ischar);

/* given fd of syspath, set vendor_id and device_id; return 0 for success */
int sysdev_getproductids(int *vendor_id, int *device_id, int sysfd);
